# Axiom.ai Backend

## Description

Backend API for Axiom.ai - an AI-powered learning platform that accelerates your learning journey by creating custom course roadmaps for any topic you want to master.

### üéØ What is Axiom.ai?

Axiom.ai revolutionizes learning by using artificial intelligence to create personalized, comprehensive course structures tailored to your specific interests. Whether you want to learn "Python programming language" or "how to swim", our AI generates detailed learning paths that adapt to your pace and goals.

### ‚ö° How It Works

1. **Topic Input**: Users enter any topic they want to learn
2. **AI Course Generation**: Our AI creates a structured course broken down into digestible units
3. **Detailed Learning Path**: Each unit contains multiple chapters with focused content
4. **Interactive Learning**: Every chapter includes:
   - Curated YouTube videos
   - Comprehensive summaries
   - Reinforcement quizzes

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This NestJS backend provides the API infrastructure that powers the Axiom.ai learning platform, handling course generation, content curation, and user progress tracking.

Built with:

- **NestJS** - Scalable Node.js framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
